## Hi 🤘
I'm a problem solver. My biggest challenge (and passion) is to always be reinventing myself every day in whatever I do.

Recently graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, with over 10 years in Web Design and interface integration (UI) in Java and PHP projects, I am transitioning to full-stack/back-end web development.

### Experience
- My stack includes JavaScript (Vanilla, TS, React, Node.js), Java, and C#, with a focus on front-end and back-end (Express, MongoDB). As a self-taught professional, I master iterations on business requirements and user experience (UX).
- I participated in agile teams (SCRUM), optimizing layouts and fixing bugs in applications for clients such as BNDES and Log-In Logística, advancing launches by up to 6 months.

#### About me
I am seeking entry-level opportunities in web development in Rio de Janeiro or remote. Let's connect to discuss how I can contribute to your team! 😊
- 📍 Rio de Janeiro - RJ, Brazil.
- 🤓 Sharing my journey on the Web Development (and personal) road.
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese & 🇺🇸 English
